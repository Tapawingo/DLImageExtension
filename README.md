A minimal and efficient **Chromium extension** that allows users to **bulk download all images** from the current webpage with ease. Designed with usability and performance in mind, this extension provides a clean UI, dark mode support, and intelligent image selection‚Äîall in a small, self-contained package.

## Features
- üîç **Scans all images** on the active tab, including lazy-loaded and off-screen assets
- ‚úÖ **Checkbox selection** for full control over which images to download
- üåì **Dark and light mode** support (follows system theme)
- üì• **One-click bulk download** of selected images
- üîß **Optional filter modal** for image size or URL keyword filters

## How It Works
1. Navigate to any website with images.
2. Click the **extension icon** in your browser toolbar.
3. The popup opens with a **visual grid** of all detected images.
4. Click an image to see it's location in the page.
5. Select or deselect images using the checkboxes.
6. Click the **Download** button to download all selected images in bulk.
